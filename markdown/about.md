## Me
<!-- I’m a designer based in New York. I’m deeply fascinated by all design practices from UI history to iconic chairs. My [master's thesis](https://sykim-me.vercel.app/blogs) included an archive of influential 20th century industrial design. During undergrad, I wrote papers on Jony Ive and Issey Miyake. In those fashion years, I learned about [supply chains](/blogs) and sewed dozens of garments myself. Growing up with an architect father, I’ve paid attention to shapes, forms and spaces at every street corner since I was a kid.  -->

I'm a Product Manager based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Currently working the cryptocurrency/blockchain industry.
Outside of work, I write code and explore the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

I was born in 1999 and grew up in Melaka, Malaysia. Recently graduated from Xiamen University Malaysia with a Software Engineering Degree.

In university, I founded and lead [XMUM Tech Club](https://www.facebook.com/xmumtechclub/) and [Google Developer Student Club XMUM](https://gdsc.community.dev/xiamen-university-malaysia-campus/). I wish to let students to explore different fields in the tech industry rather than only learning through universities lectures. So that student can be more industry prepared when graduate.

## Career
